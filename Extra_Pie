What Are Slices in Go?

A slice in Go is a dynamic, flexible view of an array. Unlike arrays,
slices do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink as needed. 
They are more commonly used in Go compared to arrays because of their dynamic nature.

Slices provide a more powerful abstraction over arrays while still using the same underlying data structure.

Article 1.2:
Interfaces (Polymorphism):
This will ask as abstact class 
In Go, interfaces define a set of method signatures but do not contain any implementation. 
Any type that implements all the methods of an interface is said to satisfy that interface, 
allowing polymorphism (the ability to use different types interchangeably).
