What Are Slices in Go?

A slice in Go is a dynamic, flexible view of an array. Unlike arrays,
slices do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink as needed. 
They are more commonly used in Go compared to arrays because of their dynamic nature.

Slices provide a more powerful abstraction over arrays while still using the same underlying data structure.
